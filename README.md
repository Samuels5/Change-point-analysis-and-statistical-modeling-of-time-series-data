# Change Point Analysis and Statistical Modeling of Time Series Data

## Project Overview

This project implements Bayesian change point detection to analyze how major geopolitical and economic events affect Brent oil prices. Developed for **Birhan Energies**, this analysis provides data-driven insights for investors, policymakers, and energy companies.

## Business Objective

Study how important events affect Brent oil prices by:

- Detecting structural breaks in oil price behavior using Bayesian methods
- Associating change points with major geopolitical and economic events
- Quantifying the impact of events on price dynamics and volatility
- Providing actionable intelligence for decision-making

## Key Features

### ðŸ“Š Core Analysis

- **Bayesian Change Point Detection** using PyMC3
- **Time Series Analysis** with stationarity testing and volatility clustering
- **Event Impact Quantification** with statistical confidence measures
- **Regime Identification** for before/after structural breaks

### ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Dashboard

- **Real-time Visualization** of oil prices and change points
- **Event Timeline** with category-based filtering
- **Impact Analyzer** for individual event analysis
- **Statistical Dashboard** with comprehensive metrics
